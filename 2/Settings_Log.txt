Settings/Log Response

 - Settings of the data generator, i.e., how many customers, products, product categories and sales the submitted version works on
		customers = 100
		product category = 10;
		products = 1000;
		sales = 10000;

 - Response time after the "Run Query" request
		- Almost instantaneous (less than a second to query 10000 sales)

 - Log of your experimentation with index choices: What was the response time of "Run Query" for various interesting index choices (and non-choices)?
    		- Indices didn't speed up the response time as much as our original queries
